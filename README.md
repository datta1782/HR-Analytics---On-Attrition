## Project Overview 
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard focused on HR Analytics with an emphasis on Employee Attrition. The goal of this project is to analyze employee turnover patterns, provide actionable insights, and create a visual representation of key HR metrics to assist organizations in improving retention strategies.

# Key Features
Attrition Analysis: The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of employee attrition by various dimensions such as department, tenure, job role, and demographic factors.
Interactive Visualizations: Users can interact with the dashboard to filter data, drill down into specific categories, and explore trends in employee turnover.
Data-Driven Insights: The dashboard highlights patterns that could indicate underlying causes of attrition, helping HR professionals develop strategies to retain talent.
# Data Cleaning & Processing
Removed Unwanted Columns: Unnecessary columns, such as "YearsWithCurrManager," were removed to streamline the analysis.
Duplicate Removal: Data integrity was ensured by removing duplicate entries from the dataset.
Corrected Spelling Errors: Inconsistent entries were standardized, such as correcting "TravelRarely" to "Travel_Rarely."
Data Type Detection: The "Detect Data Type" function in Power BI was used to accurately identify and fix data types, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
# Dashboard Visuals
Attrition by Department: Visualizes attrition rates across different departments.
Attrition by Tenure: Shows the relationship between employee tenure and attrition.
Attrition by Job Role and Age Group: Provides insights into how job roles and age groups affect turnover rates.
# Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Microsoft Excel: Employed for initial data cleaning and processing.
Power BI Functions: Leveraged built-in functions like "Detect Data Type" for data preparation.
